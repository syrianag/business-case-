## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or newer recommended)
- `npm` or your preferred package manager

### ⚙️ Installation & Setup

This project contains two main parts: the React frontend and a Node.js script for testing the API.

#### 1. Setting up the React Frontend

To run the main web application, you need to set up a client-safe environment variable.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project.
2.  **Add your OpenAI API key**, prefixed with `VITE_`. Vite requires this prefix to expose the variable to the browser.

    ```env
    # For the React Frontend (client-side)
    VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

#### 2. Setting up the Node.js Test Script (`main.js`)

The `main.js` script is a simple way to test your API key from your terminal without running the full React application.

1.  Ensure your `.env` file exists.
2.  Add your OpenAI API key **without** the `VITE_` prefix for this script to use. You can have both variables in the same file.

    ```env
    # For the Node.js test script (server-side)
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    
    # For the React Frontend (client-side)
    VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified in your terminal) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build locally to preview it before deployment.

### `npm run lint`

Lints the project files for code quality and style issues.

### `npm run format`

Formats all source files using Prettier.

### `node main.js`

Runs the standalone Node.js script to test the OpenAI API connection. It will use the `OPENAI_API_KEY` from your `.env` file.
